The World Bank is an international financial institution with 189 member countries with the primary goal of reducing poverty in developing countries. They do so by issuing loans to developing world countries, NGOs, and environmental groups. Most recently, the World Bank allocated close to $10 Billion to supply covid-19 vaccines to 78 “low and middle-income” countries. The dataset chosen for our purpose consists of the most current global development data available publicly. It includes national, regional, and global estimates of different human development indicators of various countries from 1960 to 2021. We chose this dataset because we are interested in understanding the underlying trends and progress of different countries’ developments through the years. Specifically, we would like to identify the economic, social, and environmental indicators that drive the development of a country. The proposed analysis can help the concerned in identifying the areas of development for specific countries in order to facilitate a reduction in poverty. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic World Development Indicators comprises of data about the historic levels of human development of countries in a global landscape through the years 1960 to 2021. We want to analyze this dataset and map out various trends present in the data. Some of them are listed below: We would want to evaluate different countries based on numerous economic, social, and environmental indicators for a given year, or check the progress of a single country over 4 decades. We would want to observe trends of the indicators as well. For instance, the global economy has risen by a factor of 90 in the last 6 decades. It is possible that this change results in an increasing graph of an economic indicator as opposed to any actual development. We could analyze \\(CO_2\\) emissions trends across countries and the specific sectors that contribute most to emissions. We could propose a way to track agricultural and rural development by analyzing the trend of irrigated land over the years and the livestock production index. We also have data for different age groups for all indicators. We can use such data to judge the effectiveness/contribution of indicators like education and gender in the overall development of a country. We can visualize how advances in healthcare (through indicators like mortality rates, reproductive health, etc.) have contributed to the development of the countries, and how the development of a country has improved the healthcare situation. These are some of the factors which we can visualize and give concrete conclusions about. 2.2 Data availability The source for our dataset is the governments of low- and middle-income countries for the purpose of pursuing capital projects. The World Bank’s wide range of members across different regions in the world allows for an accurate representation of progress from 1960 to current time. Most of the data is collected through the statistical systems of member countries, and the indicators are gathered through surveys or interviews with local firms (Ref). At the World Bank, the Development Data Group guides the data collection and compilation process to ensure that the data is of the highest quality and integrity. This group utilizes internationally accepted standards which results in a consistent and reliable source of data. The data has been arranged in a tidy form for the purpose of plotting in ggplot2 (i.e., the data is present in a long format). The data is available for download ini a csv format which can easily be imported into R. The World Development Indicators dataset gets updated quarterly; the latest update was in September 2022 (Ref). In the latest release, several health indicators such as immunization rates, undernourishment, and birth registrations were updated. In addition, there were also updates on world values for intentional homicides, food insecurity, and high-technology exports.
